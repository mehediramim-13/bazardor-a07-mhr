## About the project

BazarDor is a small website where you can see the daily price of everyday items in Bangladesh. Rice, lentils, oil, vegetables, fish, meat, eggs, milk and spices are all in one place. For every item you can see today's price, how much it went up or down since yesterday, and the price in different markets.

You can browse by category, sort the items by price, and open any item to see the lowest, highest and average price. The details page is only for logged in users, so you need to sign up or sign in first.

The whole site is written in Bangla and works on mobile, tablet and desktop.

## Technologies used

- Next.js (App Router) for pages and routing
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- daisyUI for ready made components like buttons
- Better Auth for authentication (email and password, Google, GitHub)
- MongoDB to store users, with the Better Auth MongoDB adapter
- react-hot-toast for toast messages
- react-icons for icons
- react-marquee-text for the scrolling price ticker
- Google Fonts through next/font (Hind Siliguri, Noto Sans Bengali, Geist)
- Vercel for deployment

## Features

1. **Live price ticker.** A strip under the navbar keeps scrolling and shows the emoji, name, price per unit and the up or down percentage of some items. It stops when you hover on it.
2. **Price up and price down sections.** The home page shows the top 6 items whose price went up today and the top 6 whose price went down.
3. **All products with sorting.** Every product is shown as a card in a responsive grid. You can sort by default, price low to high, price high to low, most increased and most decreased. The last two are extra options I added myself.
4. **Category pages.** Each category has its own page with a title, an icon and the same product cards. If the category does not exist, the user sees a friendly 404 page with a button to go back home.
5. **Product details page.** It shows the lowest, highest and average price and a market wise price table. It turns into simple cards on small screens. This page is protected, so a user who is not logged in is sent to the sign in page.
6. **Authentication.** Users can sign up and sign in with email and password, or with Google or GitHub. Errors and success messages are shown with toasts.
7. **Profile and update name.** A logged in user can open the profile page, see their details, change their name and sign out.
8. **Bangla numbers and date.** Prices and percentages use Bangla digits, and the navbar shows today's Bangla date.
9. **Loading and error states.** A loading animation is shown while data is coming, and there is a custom 404 page for wrong links.
10. **Fully responsive.** The navbar, ticker, hero, cards and tables all work well on small, medium and large screens.

## Note

I wrote this project and this README myself. I only took some help from AI to make the language and wording of the README better.
